Focusing on social cause our project is about developing a platform where all the issue of social violence, can be post 
as a complain or request to the representative organization or the representative authority. Different organization, 
authorized representative will be connecting us through web application.

As a social violence we have seen many women are still suppressed, they are being harassed on many factors. So, if 
one is being harassed, she can complain through our application directly to the authorized representative like “Maiti Nepal” 
or other organizations which are running for women’s welfare. Also, if someone is “Eye witness” for any issue they may also 
can post complain about the harassment they have seen.
In the similar pattern if anyone finds someone helpless can post for help to related authorities, one can complain through
application to the police if found theft, happening robbery, or any other illegal activities. Also post can be done as request 
for emergency medical services if sudden road accident occurs or in need of medical service.

In similar way many other requests, complains can be post on different issues happening in our society through the application 
to the authorized representative.
